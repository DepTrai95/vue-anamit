# My Vite-powered Vue-Restaurant-Website for Anamit

This is a template created from me, so that in the future I can have quick restaurant-website. It is using Vue 3 with Vite and plain CSS/SCSS. I am using the Options API here, as it was easier to get used to Vue.js and is preferred for rather small sites like this one.

This project is currentliy specifically built to be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), as it used [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/functions/) to send E-Mails.

The contact form is powered with [SendGrid](https://app.sendgrid.com/) which has good documentations and a very easy way to setup the project. All you need is to follow their instructions and implement their API-Key in your project/Netlify Environments. 
You can test it the menu-fetching and the contact-form locally by installing the [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/cli/) and setup your SendGrid.
